# "DRC Reports" OpenMRS module
DRC Reports bundles reports defined and evaluated by the [OpenMRS Reporting module](https://github.com/openmrs/openmrs-module-reporting).

It bundles two groups of reports:
1. **All-use reports** that are activated by default or
1. **Use-case specific reports** that need to be explicitely activated through Initializer's ['jsonkeyvalues'](https://github.com/mekomsolutions/openmrs-module-initializer/blob/master/readme/jsonkeyvalues.md#domain-jsonkeyvalues).<br/>:warning: DRC Reports holds a hard dependency on Initializer â‡’ both modules need to be installed for DRC Reports to work properly.
